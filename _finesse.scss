/// Finesse
///
/// Finesse is a CSS toolkit employed by Evolution 7 which utilises core parts
/// of inuit.css as well as learnings from bourbon.io among other css libraries.
///
/// All credit goes to Harry Roberts (http://csswizardry.com/) for the modified
/// version of inuit.css v5 (https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/)
/// as a base for Finesse together with an adaptation of csswizardry-grids
/// (http://csswizardry.com/csswizardry-grids/) for the grid system.
///
/// Also to Bourbon.io (http://bourbon.io/) for a slightly modified version of
/// their Bitters scaffold styles (http://bitters.bourbon.io/).
///

///
/// Variables
/// These files are where the default values for the available variables are
/// housed.
///
/// Breakpoints.scss has the most common breakpoint values to be used in our
/// media queries and grid system.
///
/// Colours.scss contain a handfull of default colours used to decorate our base
/// components and objects.
///
/// Defaults.scss contains the default type and border properties (colours,
/// sizing, font) and well as the default spacing measurement that is used for
/// the grid gutters and components default padding/margins.
///

/// Setup
/// Our default styling of the most commonly used HTML tags. Normalize.css is
/// included as a starting point and a modified version of Bourbon Bitters is
/// included to add some slightly opinionated base styles which our designs
/// should be aware of.
///
/// As with the entire framework, any default styling that is continually
/// overwritten should be re-evaluated.
