/// @description
///     It's not great practice to define solid breakpoints up-front, preferring to
///     modify your design when it needs it, rather than assuming you'll want a
///     change at 'mobile'. However, as inuit.css is required to take a hands off
///     approach to design decisions, this is the closest we can get to baked-in
///     responsiveness. It's flexible enough to allow you to set your own breakpoints
///     but solid enough to be frameworkified.
///
///     We define some broad breakpoints in our variables/_breakpoints.scss file that
///     are picked up here for use in a simple media query mixin. Our options are:
///
///         palm
///         lap
///         lap-and-up
///         portable
///         desk
///         desk-wide
///
///     Not using a media query will, naturally, serve styles to all devices.
///
/// @example
///     @include media-query(palm){ [styles here] }
///
