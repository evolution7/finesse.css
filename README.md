# Finesse.css
Finesse is a CSS toolkit created by Evolution 7 which takes learnings from a range of CSS frameworks and UI kits.

Credit goes to [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/) for the modified version of [inuit.css v5](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/) using the [ITCSS architecture](http://itcss.io/) together with an adaptation of [csswizardry-grids](http://csswizardry.com/csswizardry-grids/) for the grid system. Also to [Thoughtbot, inc.](http://thoughtbot.com/) for a slightly modified version of their [Bitters scaffold styles](http://bitters.bourbon.io/)

A visual example of the toolkit's default styles can be found [here](https://app.frontify.com/d/JiVE4P75dUCR/finesse-css-1444405267).
